# Project 01 – Forecasting Volume

This project simulates hourly support volume over 14 days and builds a simple forecasting model to predict future staffing needs.

## 📊 Objective
Use historical hourly volume data to forecast staffing needs for future days — a key component of Workforce Management (WFM).

## 🧰 Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Excel (for data sharing and analysis)

## 🧪 Method
1. Simulated 14 days of hourly volume between 8 AM and 8 PM.
2. Modeled daily traffic pattern using a sinusoidal function + random noise.
3. Averaged volume per hour over the 14 days.
4. Used the average to forecast demand for a future day.
5. Visualized historical data, average trend, and forecast.

## 📁 Files
- `demand_forecast.xlsx`: Excel with raw data, hourly averages, and forecast
- `forecasting_model.ipynb`: Python notebook used to generate the simulation and forecast
- `README.md`: This file

## 📈 Visualization
The output plot shows:
- Gray: Historical volume for each day
- Blue: Average hourly volume
- Red dashed: Forecasted volume for next day

## 📌 WFM Relevance
Forecasting is essential for:
- Accurate staffing
- Cost control
- Meeting SLAs

This project demonstrates a simple yet practical approach to demand prediction in operations and remote support environments.
